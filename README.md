# A simple to do list for bash.

Mostly lifted from [One Thing Well](http://onethingwell.org/post/4441662022/nag-ii-unix-boogaloo).  
See [this post](http://robotmachine.net/bash/2011/06/11/nag.html) for more info.  

Known issues: None!   

Fixed: [Typing `git add` without an argument will cause a blank line to be added. `nag ls` will not number that line.](https://github.com/robotmachine/nag/commit/f6af6042ff9e3f87195cf5c06550becd5aa3f872)
